# Two things this has to do that a plain `docker cp` does not:
#
#   * Strip lastModificationSignature from every resource.json. The gateway compares
#     the signature before it reads the file, so a resource copied in with its old
#     signature is silently skipped and the deploy looks like it did nothing.
#   * Touch project.json afterwards, which is what makes the gateway notice.
