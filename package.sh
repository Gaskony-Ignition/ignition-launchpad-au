# Layout follows the same Exchange convention as the ACME Alarm Demo package:
#
#   MANIFEST                    name, version, minimum Ignition, modules
#   README.md                   what it is, how to install, custom instructions
#   LICENSE                     MIT
#   Projects/<name>.zip         the project export
#   Tags/                       tag + UDT exports, and the simulator programme
#   Gateway/                    config resources a project import cannot create
#                               for itself - tag provider, database connection,
#                               historian, and (KPI) the simulator device
#
# Gateway/ is an addition to the Exchange convention, not part of it; it is
# described in each README's Custom Instructions, which is where an Exchange
# resource is expected to put anything a plain project import does not cover.
#
# The two packages are independent: either installs on its own, and where they
# overlap (tag provider, Examples database) both ship the same resource, so
# installing the second over the first is a no-op.
