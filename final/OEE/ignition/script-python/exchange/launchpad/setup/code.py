"""Build this gateway from nothing, from a button in the running session.

Everything a fresh gateway needs that is not the project itself: the database
connection, the tag provider, the historian, the simulator device and its programme,
the gateway scripting project, the tags, and then the seeding. All of it is reachable
from gateway scope, so none of it needs a Designer, an SSH session or a curl loop.

Two entry points:

    run(progress=None, force=False)   build everything that is missing
    check()                           report what is and is not in place, change nothing

Both are idempotent. `run` creates only what is absent unless `force` is set; `check`
writes nothing at all. The WebDev endpoint and the Setup button both call these, so
there is one implementation and not two that drift.

A note on the database. These projects ship SQLite at ${data}/Examples.db on purpose:
the schema is SQLite DDL, and a self-contained demo should not need a database server.
A SQLite connection needs no credentials, which is why setup can create it outright
rather than asking. If you want the demo on Postgres or MSSQL you need portable DDL
first -- pointing it at an existing connection is not enough, and the failure would be
a half-built schema rather than a clean error.
